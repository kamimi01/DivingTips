## :book: About The Project

### Description

This is an app to post and share many tips of scuba diving!

- Reasons that I built this app
  - In most cases, scuba divers dive with a buddy system, which means that 2 people dive together.
  - Instructors and other divers who dive with us give us advice such as, "If your ears hurt, it will be easier to pull them out if you surface a little"
  - But there's no opportunity to share with others because we just wrote them down to our own paper logs called "a dive log"
  - I built this app because sharing tips help us to enjoy scuba diving more comfortably.
